# PyVMEC
A Python-based GUI to create and run visuo-motor experiments.

Dependencies:

`pip install -U numpy scipy pandas six psychopy`

And you need wxPython==3.0.2.0 for now. This is still the default on Linux Mint, but is no longer available over pip. A Windows installer can be downloaded from sourceforge:
